</p>

<p><span style="color:#800080;">Column 4: Strand</span><br>
	- This is where the Strand orientation of the annotated feature is entered.<br>
	- It must be either + which denotes a forward strand or - which denotes a reverse strand.<br>
	- If not applicable, provide a period, (.).<br>
	Examples of acceptable formats: +, -, .
</p>

<p><span style="color:#800080;">Column 5: Name</span><br>
	- This is where the name of the annotated feature is entered.<br>
	- It can be alphanumeric.<br>
	- If not applicable, provide a period, (.).<br>
	- The name can be an HTML link. When the user clicks on that feature in the synteny browser, it will open the link in another tab.<br>
	Examples of acceptable formats: PAU_0022, 123.09, &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/945006"&gt;lacZ&lt;/a&gt;
</p>

<p><span style="color:#800080;">Column 6: Value</span><br>
	- This is where a Value associated with the feature can be entered.<br>
	- This is usually an expression value to generate an XY plot.<br>
	- It must be numeric or in scientific notation.<br>
	- If not applicable, provide a period, (.).<br>
	Examples of acceptable formats:  85, 35, 1e-4
</p>

<p><span style="color:#800080;">Column 7: Track</span><br>
	- This is where you can name the feature to a specific Track.<br>
	- It can be alphanumeric.<br>
	- Each unique entry in this column will result in a track.<br>
	Examples of acceptable formats: gene, transposon, expression
</p>

<p><span style="color:#800080;">Column 8: Shape</span><br>
	- This is where you can enter and define the Shape of the annotated feature.<br>
	- We support the following 7 shapes: arrow, dashline, xyplot, pentagram, christmasarrow, box and ellipse.<br>
	- It is not case-sensitive.<br>
	Examples of acceptable formats: arrow, box, xyplot
</p>

<p><span style="color:#800080;">Column 9: Color</span><br>
	- This is where you can enter and define the Color display of the Annotated feature.<br>
	- We support the following 32 colors: purple, pink, crimson, olive, sandybrown, firebrick, darkgray, tomato, seagreen, peru, lightsteelblue, salmon, khaki, skyblue, maroon, silver,<br> gold, darkgreen, orange, chocolate, darkcyan, tan, darkviolet, indianred, gainsboro, brown, gray, red, thistle, darkslategray, magenta, and black.<br>
	- If the color name is misspelled, the shape will automatically be displayed in black color.<br>
	- It is not case-sensitive.<br>
	Examples of acceptable formats:  red, chocolate, pink

	- The most common format for genome annotation information is GFF3 format. These GFF3 format files can be downloaded from NCBI(<a href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria/">ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria/</a>) <br>and other sources, or produced by running genome annotation programs on your sequence of interest.<br>
	- To convert GFF3 format into mGSV format, user will require a text file called conf.txt and a perl script called GFF3parser.pl.<br>
	- conf.txt (<a href="scripts/conf.txt">download</a>): This is a tab delimited file to extract required information from a GFF3 file, where Column 1 is the feature in the GFF3 file, Column 2 is the desired shape and <br>Column 3 is the desired color.
	<pre>   
	gene       arrow   red
	CDS     box     blue
	misc_feature    box     green
	microarray_oligo        xyplot  sky
	where - CDS, gene, mis_feature and microarray_oligo are features you want to extract from the GFF3 file.
	</pre>
	<p>- GFF3parser.pl (<a href="scripts/GFF3parser.pl">download</a>)</p>
	<pre>Usage: GFF3parser.pl -n &lt;genome&gt; -i &lt;gff3_file&gt; -c &lt;conf.txt&gt; -o &lt;output_file&gt;
	where -
	genome: name or ID of the genome
	gff3_file: name or path to GFF3 file
	conf.txt: file as described above
	output_file: name of the output file, e.g., annotation_file.txt
	</pre>
	<p>- You can combine more than one annotation_file.txt to generate a single annotation_file.txt</p>
</p>
